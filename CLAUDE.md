# CLAUDE.md

Ask me lots of questions. Ask me one at a time. For multiple-choice questions, offer buttons.

If you see a risk or think we're doing something wrong, say so immediately.

Take small steps. Commit often.

## Style

When a list is comma-separated and has more than one item, put the last item on its own line with a trailing comma.

Don't implement any more than is necessary to meet current reqirements.

## Git commit syntax

If the change only affects tests, use `. t ` as the commit message prefix.

If the change is intended to preserve existing behavior, use `@ r` as the commit message prefix.
